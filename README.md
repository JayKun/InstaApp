<h1>InstaApp</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
This project was aimed for personal development and learning. In particular, it involves familarizing myself with server creation
using Node.js's express library as well as accessing information using Instagram's API.

Once index.js is ran, the localwebhost will open a webpage that displays all photos in an Instagram account. 

<h2>Installation</h2>
You should have node and npm installed. 

<h2>Usage</h2>
Just run server.js and open up the localhost on the browser. 
```
node server.js
```
